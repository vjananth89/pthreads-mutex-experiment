# IDEA OF MAKE:
# "make TARGET" is supposed to make the TARGET file up-to-date.
# Algorithm outline for "make TARGET"
# (1) (recursively) make each of the dependencies (listed after the :)
#     This will check the up-to-dateness of each dependency.
#     Those that are updated are recorded as YOUNGER than the TARGET.
# (2) If the TARGET file is missing or one or more dependency is 
#     YOUNGER than the TARGET, then the RECIPE of COMMANDS 
#     (on tabbed lines below)  are performed.
# (3) Often, the RECIPE recreates the TARGET.  $@ within a command
#     evaluates to the TARGET (name).  
# (4) Sometime, the RECIPE doen't recreate the TARGET.  Makefile
#     programmers write such commands so "make TARGET" executes the
#     commands ALWAYS.  Examples: make config and make help  Such
#     targets, which do not name files to be made, should be declared
#     .PHONEY in a special dependency.
